# Programming Resources

This page contains a curated list of software, programming languages, and libraries needed to do ML projects. There are many frameworks for ML to choose between, in our group we have adopted [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) as our main framework and language.
