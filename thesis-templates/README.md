# Thesis Templates

This page contains a thesis template implemented in LaTeX based on the Custard document template. For simplicity we have also prepared documents in Google Docs and MS Word which mimic the styling of the LaTeX theme.

- [Google Docs Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TiyNgC6-QlDFaqPjaZeMsKPVDIw_NGBD3DClTHMksU8/edit?usp=sharing)

  This document is public but read only, you should create a local copy of the document on your own Google Docs account to modify it. 

- [Microsoft Word Template](https://github.com/CS-Swansea/Computer-Vision-and-Machine-Learning-Wiki/blob/master/thesis-templates/Word%20Thesis%20Template.docx)

  This document was created by exporting the above Google Docs template in `.docx` format. Implementing the template in Google Docs gave a more consistent user experience, whereas documents created in MS Word may look different when opened in different versions of MS Word.
